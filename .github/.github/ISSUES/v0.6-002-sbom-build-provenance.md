**Milestone:** v0.6 — Supply-chain, UX polish, Open-source hygiene  
**Epic:** Release integrity & provenance

## Description

Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and build provenance for enhanced supply chain security. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements and understand dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Attach to releases or publish in artifacts
- Document consumption

## Notes

SBOM generation is becoming a standard requirement for enterprise software. This can be implemented incrementally, starting with basic dependency listing.
