# Optional OS keychain integration (credential storage)

**Labels:** `type:feature`, `prio:med`  
**Milestone:** v0.5 — Profiles, Auth, Reliability  
**Epic:** Profiles (contexts) & secrets handling

## Description

Allow storing tokens in OS credential manager (where feasible). This provides enhanced security for credential storage on supported platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Feature flag or config toggle (keep default simple)
- Falls back to existing storage if unsupported
- Secrets never printed in debug logs

## Notes

This is an optional enhancement. The default behavior should remain simple and work across all platforms, with keychain integration as an opt-in feature.
