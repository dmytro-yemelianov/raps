# Add `CHANGELOG.md` with Keep a Changelog format

**Labels:** `type:docs`, `prio:med`  
**Milestone:** v0.6 — Supply-chain, UX polish, Open-source hygiene  
**Epic:** Repo quality & contributor workflow

## Description

Maintain a structured changelog following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. This helps users understand what changed between versions and improves transparency.

## Current Status

❌ **Not Implemented**: No CHANGELOG.md file exists in the repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Changelog entries for v0.4+ changes
- Backfill entries for v0.1-v0.3 if possible (based on git history)
- Linked to GitHub releases
- Include sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

## Implementation Notes

- Use standard Keep a Changelog format:
  ```markdown
  # Changelog
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
  
  ## [Unreleased]
  
  ## [0.4.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
  ### Added
  - ...
  ```
- Link to GitHub releases: `[0.4.0]: https://github.com/.../releases/tag/v0.4.0`
- Update changelog as part of release process

## Notes

A well-maintained changelog is a sign of a mature project and helps users track changes. The Keep a Changelog format is widely recognized and tool-friendly.
