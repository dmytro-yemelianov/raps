# Add configurable request timeouts + concurrency limits

**Labels:** `type:feature`, `prio:med`  
**Milestone:** v0.5 — Profiles, Auth, Reliability  
**Epic:** Reliability: retries, backoff, timeouts, rate limits

## Description

Avoid hanging jobs and control parallelism in bulk operations. This prevents indefinite hangs and allows users to control resource usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `--timeout <sec>` or config
- `--concurrency <n>` for bulk commands
- Safe defaults documented

## Notes

Timeouts prevent indefinite hangs. Concurrency limits help avoid overwhelming the API or local resources during bulk operations.
