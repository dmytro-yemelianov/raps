# Remove accidental artifacts from repo + extend `.gitignore`

**Labels:** `type:chore`, `prio:med`  
**Milestone:** v0.6 — Supply-chain, UX polish, Open-source hygiene  
**Epic:** Repo quality & contributor workflow

## Description

Keep the repository clean by ensuring development artifacts and build outputs are not tracked. This reduces repository size and prevents accidental commits of generated files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dev logs/build artifacts are not tracked
- `.gitignore` updated
- CI remains green

## Current Status

✅ **Partially Implemented**: `.gitignore` exists and covers common Rust artifacts. Review needed for:
- Dev logs (if any are generated)
- Build artifacts in `target/` (already ignored)
- Generated files in `generated-files/` (already ignored)

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Check for any log files that might be tracked
- [ ] Verify `target/` is properly ignored (already in .gitignore)
- [ ] Check for any temporary files or caches
- [ ] Ensure CI artifacts are not tracked
- [ ] Review if any generated documentation should be ignored

## Notes

A clean repository is easier to navigate and reduces merge conflicts. This should be done carefully to ensure CI continues to work correctly.
